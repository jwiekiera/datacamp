# Exploring NYC Public School Test Result Scores
*This is my solution to project from DataCamp.*

## Which NYC schools have the best math results?

* The best math results are at least 80% of the **maximum possible score of 800** for math.
* Save your results in a pandas DataFrame called `best_math_schools`, including `"school_name"` and `"average_math"` columns, sorted by `"average_math"` in descending order.

## What are the top 10 performing schools based on the combined SAT scores?

* Save your results as a pandas DataFrame called `top_10_schools` containing the `"school_name"` and a new column named `"total_SAT"`, with results ordered by `"total_SAT"` in descending order.

## Which single borough has the largest standard deviation in the combined SAT score?

* Save your results as a pandas DataFrame called `largest_std_dev`.
* The DataFrame should contain one row, with:
    - `"borough"` - the name of the NYC borough with the largest standard deviation of `"total_SAT"`.
    - `"num_schools"` - the number of schools in the borough.
    - `"average_SAT"` - the mean of `"total_SAT"`.
    - `"std_SAT"` - the standard deviation of `"total_SAT"`.
* Round all numeric values to two decimal places.
